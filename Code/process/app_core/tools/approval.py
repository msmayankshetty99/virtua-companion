"""Per-call approval gate; permissions never come from model output. A rule belongs to one tool of one source, keyed
(source, name) like Tool.approval_key, so a configured MCP server's tool never inherits a rule set for one of Riko's own
however it is named. tool_approvals.json is {"version": 2, "sources": {source: {name: bool}}, "legacy": {name: bool}},
true meaning ask before each call; a file from before sources ({name: bool}) loads as legacy and is rewritten on the
next save. The file also keeps a top-level {name: bool} mirror, ignored here: builds before sources read only that, so a
downgrade still asks before any tool that some source asks before (it fails closed, never open)."""
